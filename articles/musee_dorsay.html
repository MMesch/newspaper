The Musée d'Orsay is a museum in Paris, France, on the left bank of the Seine.
It is housed in the former Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built
between 1898 and 1900. The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to
1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography. It houses
the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in
the world, by painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat,
Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie
nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986. It is one of
the largest art museums in Europe.
